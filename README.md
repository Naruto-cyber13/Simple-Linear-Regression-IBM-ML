# Simple-Linear-Regression-IBM-ML
Simple linear regression model to predict emissions from engine size
# ðŸš— Emission Prediction using Simple Linear Regression

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a simple linear regression model using Python and Scikit-learn. The goal is to predict vehicle emissions based on engine size.

ðŸ“š Acknowledgments
This project was developed as part of my learning from the IBM Machine Learning with Python course offered by IBM on Coursera.

The course provided a strong foundation in supervised learning, model evaluation, and scikit-learn workflows â€” key concepts used in this project.

Special thanks to IBM and Coursera for offering such valuable educational resources to the public.

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Overview

Using a basic machine learning pipeline, this project:
- Loads and splits data into training and testing sets
- Trains a `LinearRegression` model
- Visualizes the regression line
- Evaluates performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ²

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## ðŸ”§ How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Naruto-cyber13/Simple-Linear-Regression-IBM-ML.git
cd Simple-Linear-Regression-IBM-ML
### 2. **Install dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt

### 3. Run the model

### âœ… Bonus Tip: Enable GitHub Notebook Viewer

GitHub automatically renders `.ipynb` files. But for better formatting and sharing, you can use:
- [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)
- Export as HTML and link it in README
